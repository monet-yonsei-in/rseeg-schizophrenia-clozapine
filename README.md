# CSD DCM perturbation example for resting-state EEG

This code contains a simlple example of perturbation CSD DCM.

'Neuropharmacological computational analysis of longitudinal electroencephalograms in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia using hierarchical dynamic causal modeling'

## Pre-requisties

This code is worked on MATLAB and SPM12.
The code was developed using MATLAB 2020b and tested with MATLAB 2020b.

## Setup 
First, move to rseeg-schizophrenia-clozapine folder and run setup in the MATLAB Command Window:
```
>> setup
```
You will get a message the setup ran successfully.

## Example 1
All parameter scale perturbation from baseline to follow-up DCM posterior parameters.

```
>> DCM_perturbation_example1
```
This code was written in MATLAB Livescript.

## Example 2
